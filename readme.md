# Edge avoiding Robot with Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor

## Description

This Arduino sketch controls the direction and speed of four DC motors using an H-Bridge motor driver and a 74HC595 shift register. Additionally, it uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance, making the motors react based on the sensor input. When the detected distance exceeds a threshold, the motors stop, move backward, and then turn right.

## Components

- Arduino Uno
- 74HC595 Shift Register
- L293D H-Bridge Motor Driver IC
- Four DC Motors
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Motor Shield
- Jumper Wires

### Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- **Trigger Pin**: Pin 2
- **Echo Pin**: Pin 13

## Code Explanation

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor Measurement**:
   - The ultrasonic sensor is triggered using the `trigPin1`. The distance is calculated by measuring the duration of the echo using `pulseIn()`. The result is converted to millimeters by the `microsecondsToMillimeters()` function.

2. **Motor Control Functions**:
   - The code defines functions to control the motors (`fw()`, `bw()`, `turnRight()`, `turnLeft()`, `stopMotor()`), each utilizing the `motor()` function to send commands to the motors.
   - The `motor()` function sends commands like `FORWARD`, `BACKWARD`, `BRAKE`, and `RELEASE` to control the motors, while `motor_output()` handles setting the motor's direction and speed using PWM.

3. **Shift Register Control**:
   - The `shiftWrite()` function shifts the output signals using a 74HC595 shift register to drive multiple motor outputs.
   - It manages the initialization of the shift register and latches output to drive motors based on the control signals.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - In the `loop()` function, the code continuously measures the distance using the ultrasonic sensor and prints the distance to the serial monitor.
   - Depending on the distance, the motors either move forward or perform actions like stopping, moving backward, or turning.

## Usage

1. **Wiring**:
   - Connect the motors, ultrasonic sensor, and the 74HC595 shift register to the Arduino based on the pin mapping mentioned above.
   
2. **Upload Code**:
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Operation**:
   - When the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle within 75mm, the motors stop, move backward, and turn right.
   - If no obstacle is detected within 75mm, the motors move forward.

## Calibration

The value used in `microsecondsToMillimeters()` for converting the ultrasonic sensor reading may need adjustment based on the environment and sensor accuracy. Modify the divisor in the function for calibration.

```cpp
float microsecondsToMillimeters(long microseconds)
{
  return microseconds / 1.4 / 4;  // Adjust the 2.8 value as needed for calibration
}
